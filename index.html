    Niall is a graduate in Data Science from the University of Warwick. Throughout his degree he gained extensive
    experience using R for a range of data analytics and visualisation projects, including his final year dissertation
    which centred around global cinema box office data. As well as this Niall is comfortable using Python for
    implementing machine learning models and basic data visualisation. He also has experience with Java.
  </p>
  <p>
    Niall’s interests lay mainly within the area of data science, specifically in the development and implementation of
    machine learning models to handle and process large data sets. Given the opportunity he would also be interested in
    gaining more experience in alternative areas of software development in the future.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of academic studies Niall’s interests include amateur dramatics and tennis through which he has gained
    valuable communication skills alongside the ability to work well within teams of different sizes and with various
    goals.
